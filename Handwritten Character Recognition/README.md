## Introduction

Handwritten character recognition is a fundamental problem in pattern recognition and machine learning. This repository provides MATLAB code to recognize handwritten characters using various machine learning techniques.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:

- MATLAB (R2016b or later recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/handwritten-character-recognition.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository directory:

```bash
cd handwritten-character-recognition
```

## Usage

1. Open MATLAB and navigate to the repository directory.
2. Run the `letterclassification.mlx` script to execute the entire handwritten character recognition pipeline.
3. Experiment with different parameters, models, or algorithms by modifying the `letterclassification.mlx` script.
4. View and analyze the results generated by the script.

## File Structure

The repository has the following structure:

- `letterclassification.mlx`: Main script to run the handwritten character recognition pipeline.
- `preparedata.mlx`: Helper function for preprocessing raw data.

## Data

Ensure the raw data for handwritten characters is stored in the `Data` directory. Each character's data should be saved in a separate text file.

## Results

After running the `letterclassification.mlx` script, the results will be saved in the `letterfeatures.mat` file. This file contains the training and testing datasets, along with associated filenames.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the program or add additional classifiers are welcome. Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgments

- The code in this repository was inspired by various tutorials, research papers, and examples on machine learning and handwriting recognition.
