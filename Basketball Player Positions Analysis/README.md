# Basketball Player Positions Analysis

This MATLAB script performs an analysis of basketball player positions using various clustering techniques and dimensionality reduction methods based on height, weight, and game statistics.

## Introduction

The script analyzes a dataset of basketball player data, categorizing players into natural groupings based on their performance metrics per game.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Download Data**: Download the basketball player data (`basketballDataProcessed.csv`) and place it in the same directory as the MATLAB script.

3. **Run the Script**: Open MATLAB and run the `basketball_analysis.mlx` script. Ensure MATLAB is properly configured and all required toolboxes are installed.

4. **Interpret Results**: Review the generated visualizations and analyses to understand the clustering patterns and groupings of basketball players based on their positions and performance metrics.

## Repository Structure

- `basketball_analysis.mlx`: MATLAB script containing the analysis code.
- `basketballDataProcessed.csv`: Dataset containing basketball player data.
- `README.md`: Documentation providing an overview of the analysis and instructions for usage.
