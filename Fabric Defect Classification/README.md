## Introduction
The program is designed to compare the performance of classifiers such as k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Discriminant Analysis, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) on a fabric defect dataset. It evaluates the classifiers based on their resubstitution loss and validation loss.

## Usage
This MATLAB script is intended for educational and research purposes. It provides a framework for evaluating different classifiers on fabric defect classification data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this program (`FABRICDATASET.xlsx`) contains features related to fabric defects. It is loaded into the program using MATLAB's `xlsread` function.

## Dependencies
- MATLAB (R2016a or later)

## Installation
To use this program, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_URL>
```

## Instructions
1. Ensure MATLAB is installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
3. Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory containing the MATLAB script (`fabric_defect_classification.m`).
4. Run the script in MATLAB to execute the classification and evaluation process.
5. View the results displayed in the MATLAB console.

## Results
The program displays the performance metrics of each classifier, including resubstitution loss and validation loss. It also calculates the accuracy of each classifier based on confusion matrices.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the program or add additional classifiers are welcome. Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
