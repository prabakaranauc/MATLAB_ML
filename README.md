## Introduction

 I have implemented a variety of machine learning algorithms and techniques using MATLAB. The algorithms cover a wide range of tasks including classification, regression, clustering, and more. Each algorithm is accompanied by detailed documentation and example usage to facilitate understanding and usage.

## Features

- **Implementation of Various Algorithms**: The repository contains implementations of popular machine learning algorithms such as:
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Neural Networks
  - And more...

- **Documentation and Examples**: Each algorithm comes with detailed documentation explaining its theory, implementation details, and practical examples demonstrating its usage on sample datasets. This documentation aims to provide clarity and insights into the workings of each algorithm.

- **Modular Structure**: The project is organized into separate directories for each algorithm, making it easy to navigate and understand. Each directory contains the algorithm implementation along with example scripts showcasing its usage.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you'll need MATLAB installed on your system.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/machine-learning-portfolio.git
```

2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.

3. Explore the implementations and examples provided in each algorithm's directory. Run the example scripts to see the algorithm in action.

## Usage

After cloning the repository and navigating to the desired algorithm's directory in MATLAB, you can run the example scripts to see the algorithm in action.

```matlab
cd algorithms/linear_regression
example
```

Feel free to modify the examples or integrate these algorithms into your own MATLAB projects as needed.
