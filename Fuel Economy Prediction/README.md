# Fuel Economy Prediction

This MATLAB script trains regression models to predict the fuel economy of vehicles using various machine learning techniques.

## Introduction

The script utilizes a dataset (`carData.csv`) containing features such as engine displacement, vehicle weight, and other attributes to predict fuel economy (measured in liters per 100 km).

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Download Data**: Ensure you have the `carData.csv` file in the same directory as the MATLAB script.(This dataset is provided courtesy of MathWorks)

3. **Run the Script**: Open MATLAB and run the `fuel_economy_prediction.mlx` script. Make sure MATLAB is properly configured and all required toolboxes are installed.

4. **Interpret Results**: Review the generated visualizations and analyses to understand the performance of different regression models in predicting fuel economy.

## Repository Structure

- `fuel_economy_prediction.mlx`: MATLAB script containing the prediction code.
- `carData.csv`: Dataset containing vehicle features and fuel economy data.
- `README.md`: Documentation providing an overview of the script and instructions for usage.
